# C# Top Down Game Project in Raylib
## Introduction
This is an unfinished game project which will not be continued as my vision for the game has changed and I will be changing frameworks.
This was meant to be a top-down game like Rimworld, where you can edit the terrain, but what's different is that you can control a main player and move around using WASD, rather than being a colony simulation like Rimworld.
However, my vision has changed and I will be aiming for a voxel game like Minecraft, which means most of the code here cannot be translated nor refactored in a way that is more beneficial than making the whole new project.
This has been a great experience for me to learn about core game development principles.

## Features
- Movable character using WASD from a Top-Down perspective
- Zoom in and zoom out in-game
- Generated world of x * y tiles, with boundaries where the player cannot move outside the x * y tiles
- Each tile has a default terrain and can have a flooring or/and an obejct
- Inventory system where you can click and drag, as well as join item stacks together
- Able to drop items using Q and pick items up when in range
- You can remove flooring, and place down walls
